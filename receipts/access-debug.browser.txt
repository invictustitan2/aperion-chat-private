HTTP status: 302

Result: redirect from Access (likely service auth not applied or not matching).
Likely causes checklist:
- Access policy for this app must include a Service Auth rule (Action=SERVICE AUTH), not just ALLOW.
- Access app hostname/path must match: chat.aperion.cc and /api/v1/* (or broader).
- Enable 'Return 401 Response for Service Auth policies' to avoid redirects.
- Confirm policy changes are saved/published (no pending drafts).
