This document intentionally does not provide current UI guidance.

For current, repo-backed UI contracts, use:

- `docs/E2E_SELECTOR_CONTRACT.md` (what tests rely on)
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` (current reality)

For the historical exported recommendations artifact, see:

- `docs/ENTERPRISE_UI_RECOMMENDATIONS.html`
